# E-Commerce Site

### This is an e-commerce site built with React, Redux, Node.js, and a Firebase Backend. It acts as a simulated version of a typical e-commerce site you would find on the web. Basic functionality includes a working cart and checkout system, the ability to sign in by email or with Google, and the ability to process payments with Stripe (simulation card details provided). It was my first time working with Redux in an attempt to familiarize myself with the technology. In the future, I plan to incorporate React Hooks, Contet API, and GraphQL.


### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure
below.

    $ node --version
    v0.10.24

    $ npm --version
    1.3.21

#### Node installation on OS X

You will need to use a Terminal. On OS X, you can find the default terminal in
`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

Please install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if it's not already done with the following command.

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

If everything when fine, you should run

    brew install node

#### Node installation on Linux

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nodejs

#### Node installation on Windows

Just go on [official Node.js website](http://nodejs.org/) & grab the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it.
